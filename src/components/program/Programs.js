                <strong><em>Feeling isolated as a small business owner or has revenue or profit plateaued or even
                    started to decline?</em></strong></p>
            <p></p>

            <blockquote><p><em>“When I started this program I was struggling. It didn&#39;t matter if it was a good or
                bad economy. Our sales were flat. We couldn&#39;t increase sales and were always in the hole. I entered
                the program, and the instructor made a lot of promises that I didn&#39;t believe were going to be true,
                but assured me they would. I would go into class every session thinking I had all the answers, and I
                would leave, wondering how I was still in business. Every class I went to I always left thinking and
                trying to figure out what I was doing wrong, and I would always get my answers from my other classmates.
                After graduating I finally understood how to run a business instead of how to do my job. Sales
                increased, doubled, doubled, and doubled to a point where we got 7 or 8 full-time employees. Most of the
                employees have been with me since I took the class 10 years ago. Most of them were hourly employees and
                now they&#39;re all homeowners.”</em></p>
